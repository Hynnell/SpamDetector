Spam Detector

-----------------------------

Description: Our system is designed to allow users to determine whether a message is spam or not. The user can choose between testing messages with two machine learning models trained with either default datasets or inputted datasets. This system uses the k-nearest neighbor algorithm and the perceptron algorithm to predict the result of inputted data.
